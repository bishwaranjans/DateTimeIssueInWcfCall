DateTime issue in WCF service call:-

Sometimes we face problem in working datetime timezones with wcf service calls.
e.g. in my situation I have code that passes date into WCF via JSON object.
Suppose I am sending my date as "12/02/2013"(dd/mm/YYYY format) from jquery side, it was getting the date as "11/02/2013" on the service method.

This was happening because of the time zone difference between my server and client.

The solution to this problem is convert the Datetime object being passed to the server into UTC ( Datetime.ToUniversalTime) before passing it.
That way we always receive the UTC time at the server, irrespective of wherever the clients exists.

And on the client, whenever you receive the Datetime, convert it to the localtime ( DateTime.ToLocalTime ).

Example:-

	I have a input type date where I am setting date via a date picker.Suppose I have set value to the textbox as '12/10/2013'.
	Now we need to add the following code in our method where we are creating the JSON object.
	
	var date = '12/10/2013';
	
	//  Making date object from date string parameter
    var newDate = new Date();
    var splitStringDate = date.split("/");

    // Setting new date
    newDate.setMonth((splitStringDate[1] - 1), splitStringDate[0]);
    newDate.setDate(splitStringDate[0]);
    newDate.setYear(splitStringDate[2]);
	
	// Here we will set date object to Utc
	var utcDate = new Date(Date.UTC(newDate.getFullYear(), newDate.getMonth(), newDate.getDate(), newDate.getHours(), newDate.getMinutes(), newDate.getSeconds(), newDate.getMilliseconds()));
	
	// In wcf service always we have to pass the date as follows
	
	var finalDate = '/Date(' + utcDate.getTime() + ')/';
	
Now , we can send this date object(finalDate) to service method so that it will always get the UTC time.

Hope it helps!
Happy Coding.
